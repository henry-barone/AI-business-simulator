# Questionnaire "Next" Button Error Fix

## 🐛 Problem Diagnosed

When users clicked the "Next" button in the Business Assessment questionnaire, an error occurred preventing progression through the questionnaire.

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

### Issue 1: Wrong Model Import
The questionnaire submission endpoint in `routes/companies.py` was trying to import `QuestionnaireResponse` from the wrong location:

```python
# ❌ WRONG (causing import error)
from models.questionnaire import QuestionnaireResponse

# ✅ CORRECT
from models.simulation import QuestionnaireResponse
```

**Impact**: The backend couldn't process questionnaire submissions, causing API calls to fail.

### Issue 2: Static Mock Questions
The questionnaire `/next` endpoint was only returning a single hardcoded question instead of progressing through a sequence:

```python
# ❌ WRONG (always returned same question)
mock_question = {
    'id': 'q1',
    'text': 'What is your primary business focus?',
    # ... always the same
}
```

**Impact**: Users couldn't progress past the first question.

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### Fix 1: Corrected Model Import
Updated `routes/companies.py` to import the correct `QuestionnaireResponse` model:

```python
# Fixed import
from models.simulation import QuestionnaireResponse
```

This model correctly uses `company_id` (integer) instead of `session_id` (string).

### Fix 2: Dynamic Questionnaire Flow
Implemented a proper 5-question dynamic questionnaire in `routes/questionnaire.py`:

```python
questions = [
    {
        'id': 'q1',
        'text': 'What is your primary business focus?',
        'type': 'select',
        'options': ['Manufacturing', 'Services', 'Retail', 'Technology'],
        'required': True
    },
    {
        'id': 'q2', 
        'text': 'How many employees does your company have?',
        'type': 'select',
        'options': ['1-10', '11-50', '51-200', '200+'],
        'required': True
    },
    # ... 3 more questions
]

# Logic to return next question based on answered count
answered_count = len(previous_answers)
if answered_count >= len(questions):
    return completion_response
else:
    return questions[answered_count]
```

### Fix 3: Completion Handling
Updated both backend and frontend to properly handle questionnaire completion:

**Backend**: Returns completion signal when all questions answered
```python
{
    'data': {
        'completed': True,
        'message': 'Questionnaire completed successfully'
    }
}
```

**Frontend**: Handles completion response properly
```typescript
if (data.data.completed) {
    onComplete();
} else if (data.data.question) {
    setCurrentQuestion(data.data.question);
    // ...
}
```
